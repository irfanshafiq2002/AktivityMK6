    <h2>Demonstrating the Box Model</h2>
    <p>
        The CSS box model is essentially a
        box that wraps around every HTML
        element. It consists of: borders,
        padding, margins, and the actual
        content.
    </p>
    <div>
        This is what the box looks like when its 
        being shown. I hope you guys can see it.
        This is very stressful work. But we have to keep going.
